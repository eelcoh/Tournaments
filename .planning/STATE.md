## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v1.1 work:
- iOS Safari install prompt: pass navigator.standalone as Elm flag (from index.html/JS)
- Any new static assets must be added to APP_SHELL in src/sw.js
- Scroll wheel uses buildWindow (flat-list + index) for strict 7-item output; WLPadding at 44px eliminates height jumps
- Group label anchoring replaces only above[0] (line 1), never above[1]/above[2]
- deferredPrompt captured in <head> before main.js loads; forwarded to Elm via onBeforeInstallPrompt port after init
- isIOS and isStandalone passed as flags (sync); BeforeInstallPrompt availability via port message (async)
- BannerShowingIOS derived in init from isIOS flag; BannerShowingAndroid set when port fires
- Single inFront column stacks install banner above status bar — avoids z-index issues
- BannerHidden returns Element.none — no DOM node, no layout shift

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None — clean slate for v1.1.
